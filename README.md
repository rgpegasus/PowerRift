<h1 align="center">PowerRift - Platformer fighter </h1>

**PowerRift** is a platform fighter developed by 5 EPITA students. Players battle in floating arenas, aiming to knock opponents off the platform in 1v1, 2v2, or against bots. New weapons appear during fights, and every hit increases damage, making opponents easier to throw. Fill your "Rift Gauge" to unleash a powerful ultimate that can turn the match around. Choose from diverse characters and interactive arenas — skill, strategy, and control decide the winner.
